##Undead Rising: Horrors of the Flesh: Fear and Myth in Spring: 1944


This is a mod for Spring:1944. It features objective based gameplay, armies that stay with you from game to game, and a basic "shop" for buying units at the start of rounds. Plus, sometimes you get to play as zombies, and mess everyone up!

## Playing
Currently in fairly rough shape (old!), best bet is to post on the spring1944.net forums for help.

##Gameplay
This is a 3 player game. At the start of each round, players spend their available funds to buy new units. Once that's done, the gameplay begins. One player is (semi)randomly selected to be the Zombie player. The other two players (Humans) each receive an Objective. 

###Objective Phase - 10 minutes
The Objectives currently are:

* **Rescue** civilians: fetch 50 of them from their hiding places in houses and return them to your starting area. 
* **Purge** Zombie Hotzones: seek out and destroy at least 4 zombie spawning points.
* **Control** key map areas for a total of 10 minutes (1 flag for 10 minutes, or 10 flags for 1 minute).

The goals of the Humans are to:

1. accomplish their given objective
2. prevent the other Human from accomplishing theirs.


The goal of the Zombie is to cause them to fail at _either_ of those two goals.

###Endgame - 2 minutes
At the end of the Objective Phase (10 minutes), the Endgame begins. The winning player (Human or Zombie) is rewarded with a massive supply of reinforcements and a mandate to wipe the map clean. Everyone else has to survive for two minutes and beat a hasty retreat.


Winning the game (as well as other actions, like killing zombies, rescuing civilians, or destroying Hot Zones) gives you more money. Money may be used to purchase more reinforcements at the start of the next round.
